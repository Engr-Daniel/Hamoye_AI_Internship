Python has been rated by data science and machine learning professionals as their most preferred programming language. As a first step towards to expert voyage, I learnt about Python programming language, especially how it is used in analysis and data science, including the data science pipeline in this stage. 

This stage also explores how machine learning techniques can be an invaluable tool for solving problems

At the end of this stage, I was able to:
Work on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualisations on a public utility data containing millions of rows and tens of files in structured format.
